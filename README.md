# Example Java XML Consumer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pactflow/example-consumer-java-soap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pactflow/example-consumer-java-soap)

This is an example of a Java SOAP consumer that uses Pact, [Pactflow](https://pactflow.io) and Travis CI to ensure that it is compatible with the expectations its consumers have of it.

The project uses a Makefile to simulate a very simple build pipeline with two stages - test and deploy.

See the canonical consumer example here: https://github.com/pactflow/example-consumer
See also the full [Pactflow CI/CD Workshop](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/workshops/ci-cd) for which this can be substituted in as the "consumer".
